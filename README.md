# RP2040-Reference-Board
Compact RP2040 board ready to use with integrated projects

Download Kicad files, place into a folder, and import into KiCad. To use in your own project, copy and paste the PCB traces and the schematic into your own project and adjust nets as needed.

[This Github](https://github.com/ai03-2725/Type-C.pretty) has all of the files you need for USB C. It's also where the footprint for this project came from. 

The USB C port can be safely removed and sent through pins or a ribbon cable for a more compact design.
