# RP2040-Reference-Board
Compact RP2040 board ready to use with integrated projects

Download Kicad files, place into a folder, and import into KiCad. To use in your own project, copy and paste the PCB traces and the schematic into your own project and adjust nets as needed.

[This Github](https://github.com/ai03-2725/Type-C.pretty) has all of the files you need for USB C. It's also where the footprint for this project came from. 

The USB C port can be safely removed and sent through pins or a ribbon cable for a more compact design.

If you want to use this in your own project, download the kicad files and alter the file instead of trying to import the design into a preexisting file. It saves a lot of trouble.

If this is to be used in a keyboard, USB Boot can be connected to one of the keyboard keys (to ground). Otherwise, put in a push button or a way to short its pins to ground.
